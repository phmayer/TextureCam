for the texture maps generator:



picture gets taken by camera
-> picture then gets saved as a file (?)
-> for every picture taken we create a folder with the timestamp as name
-> the original picture gets a name like 'original'

then after picture was taken and saved successfully,
then the texture generator module gets called

a function is called, and as argument the path to the folder with the picture is given????
or do we just work with picture objects????
